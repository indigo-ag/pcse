This repository contains a fork of PCSE (https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse). PCSE: The Python Crop Simulation Environment was developed by Wageningen-UR.

## Indigo Ag Features Added
Indigo Ag added four Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) models with an ensembling capability as well as a soil temperature model. These models were adapted from earlier implementations for interoperability with the PCSE framework. See pcse/soil/SOC.py and pcse/soil/Soil_Temp.py for license information.
